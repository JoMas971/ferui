# Contribution process for developers

If you plan on contributing code to FerUI, please follow this step-by-step process in order to reduce the risk of major changes being requested when you submit your pull request. We'll work with you on every step and try to be as responsive as possible.

## I. Proposal template

Before you start coding anything, please fill out the following proposal template in as much detail as you can. The more complete your details the better, but not all questions will apply for every change.
As you fill this out, please make sure to follow [our guidelines](/CODING_GUIDELINES.md#public-api) for the public API of components.

```markdown
## Summary

Describe the change or feature in detail. Try to answer the following questions.

* What is the change?
* What is a use case for this change?
* Why should it go in FerUI?
* Does this change impact existing behaviors? If so how?
* If this change introduces a new behavior, is this behavior accessible?

## Examples

_If possible, show examples of the change. You may create one yourself, or link to external sites that have the idea. It can also be very useful to prototype the idea in isolation outside of FerUI with a Stackblitz example._

## API

_Describe the intended API for the feature you want to add. This would include:_

* CSS classes and DOM structure for pure static UI contribution, and inputs/outputs, components, directives, services, or anything that is exported publicly for Angular contributions.
* Examples of code snippets using this new feature.
* Note very clearly if anything **might** be a breaking change.

_In the case of bug fixes or internal changes, there will most likely be no API changes._

## Implementation Plan

_Describe how you plan to implement the feature, answering questions among the following or anything else you deem relevant._

* What parts of the code are affected?
* Will you introduce new services, components or directives?
* Can you describe the basic flow of information between classes?
* Does this introduce asynchronous behaviors?
* Will you need to refactor existing FerUI code?
* Will reasonable performance require optimizations?
* Will it need to access native elements (and be incompatible with server-side rendering)?
* ...

## Conclusion

_Describe how long you expect it to take to implement, what help you might need, and any other details that might be helpful. Don't worry, this is obviously non-contractual. ðŸ˜›_
```

Once it's ready, post it either on the original GitHub issue for bug fixes or in a new issue otherwise. If you are planning on implementing an already designed component, please mention the issue containing the existing specification in your proposal. If the original issue hasn't been updated in a while, please ping @ilanddev/ninjas on the issue to ensure we will start the discussion as soon as possible.

We will discuss the proposal with you publicly on the issue, potentially requesting changes, and hopefully accept it.

## II. Implementation on a topic branch

### Prerequisites

Make sure you first:

* Read our [coding guidelines](/CODING_GUIDELINES.md).

### Getting started

When we post on the issue to approve your proposal, the person on the team who'll be your primary contact will post a link to a topic branch against which you will submit your pull requests. The topic branch will be branched from the latest `master` and named `topic/{feature-name}`. To merge any pull request into this branch it will need 2 approval from team members.

Start by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the main FerUI repository, and follow the instructions in the previous link to clone your fork and set the upstream remote to the main FerUI repository. Finally, create a local topic branch from the upstream `topic/{feature-name}` mentioned above.

For instance, this setup part could look like this:

```shell
## Clone your forked repository
git clone git@github.com:<github username>/ferui.git

## Navigate to the directory
cd ferui

## Set name and e-mail configuration
git config user.name "John Doe"
git config user.email johndoe@example.com

## Setup the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ilanddev/ferui.git

## Check out the upstream a topic branch for your changes
git fetch
git checkout -b topic/feature-name upstream/topic/feature-name
```

### Commits

If your contribution is large, split it into smaller commits that are logically self-contained. You can then submit them as separate pull requests that we will review one by one and merge progressively into the topic branch. As a rule of thumb, try to keep each pull request under a couple hundred lines of code, _unit tests included_. We realize this isn't always easy, and sometimes not possible at all, so feel free to ask how to split your contribution in the GitHub issue. In general, it's a good idea to start coding the services first and test them in isolation, then move to the components.

For your commit message, please use the following format:

```
[<type>] <title>
<BLANK LINE>
<detailed commit message>
<BLANK LINE>
<reference to closing an issue>
<BLANK LINE>
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Type must be one of the following:

* `UX`: Research and design principles. These are typically documentation commits.
* `ICON`: Implementation of FerUI's Custom Element icons.
* `UI`: Implementation of FerUI's static styles, its general look-and-feel.
* `NG`: Implementation of FerUI's Angular components.
* `DOC`: Documentation updates.
* `CORE`: Distribution, build script and tooling.
* `SCHEMATICS`: Implementation of schematics for Angular CLI.

These documents provide guidance creating a well-crafted commit message:

* [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* [Closing Issues Via Commit Messages](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)

### Submitting pull requests

As you implement your contribution, make sure all work stays on your local topic branch. When an isolated part of the feature is complete with unit tests, make sure to submit your pull request **against the topic branch** on the main Clarity repository instead of `master`. This will allow us to accept and merge partial changes that shouldn't make it into a production release of FerUI yet. We expect every pull request to come with exhaustive unit tests for the submitted code.

**Do not, at any point, rebase your local topic branch on newer versions of `master` while your work is still in progress!** This will create issues both for you, the reviewers, and maybe even other developers who might submit additional commits to your topic branch if you requested some help.

To make sure your pull request will pass our automated testing, before submitting you should:

* Make sure `npm test` passes for each of them.
  // More comming soon

If everything passes, you can push your changes to your fork of FerUI, and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Remember, submit it **against the topic branch** on the main FerUI repository, not `master`!

### Taking reviews into account

During the review process of your pull request(s), some changes might be requested by FerUI team members. If that happens, add extra commits to your pull request to address these changes. Make sure these new commits are also signed and follow our commit message format.

**Do not amend your commits or squash them**, it will only slow down the review process by forcing reviewers to check every line again. We'll clean up the commit history ourselves when we finally merge your pull request, you don't have to worry about it.

### Shipping it

Once your contribution is fully implemented, reviewed and ready, we will rebase the topic branch on the newest `master` and squash down to fewer commits if needed (keeping you as the author, obviously). Chances are we will be more familiar with potential conflicts that might happen, but we can work with you if you want to solve some conflicts yourself. Once rebased we will merge the topic branch into `master`, which involves a quick internal pull request you don't have to worry about, and we will finally delete the topic branch.

At that point, your contribution will be available in the next official release of FerUI.

## New item guidelines

When a new item is created and added to the public API, the following things should be verified to ensure it is exported and tested fully.

* Ensure every new public item is re-exported through the `public_api.ts` file. Usually there are `index.ts` files in directories that any public items should be re-exported through, and then the `index.ts` files are re-exported up the tree. This only applies inside of `src/ferui-components` directory.
* Ensure that every time you import inside of `ferui-components` directory that you import from the direct file, and not an index. This can be misleading and hard to catch, but it breaks AoT compilation if you don't export it correctly.

If it is not meant to be a public item (like a private service), be sure not to include it in the `public_api.ts`.
